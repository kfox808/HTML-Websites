        Hey everyone, it's Ki! Here is my gallery of my artwork. Made straight from Chicago, Il! Some is wearable and some can be just for display. Some pieces will speak to
        you. Feel free to browse around because you never know what's calling for you. Thank you so your support and visiting my gallery.

      Sincerely,
